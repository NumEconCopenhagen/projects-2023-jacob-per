This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from **DST** on **exchange rates** and **production levels**. With this we show that exchangerates have minimal effect on production levels with varying degrees of effect in different industries.
3. Model project. We model an **OLG model** under different pension systems and how these systems are affected by an exogenous shock to employment.
4. Exam project
